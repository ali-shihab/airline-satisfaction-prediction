# Group 25 - Run Instructions

CONTRIBUTORS: Ali, Adam, Paula
Ali: All sections, except Adam's and Paula's
Adam: Factory Analysis subsection
Paula: Satisfaction by Rating Subsection

## Project Structure

1. The main pipeline is in R-markdown format for ease of running, under "G25_fullPipeline.Rmd";
2. Preprocess.R is a custom written (with some borrowing from the labs) "library" of functions used in the main scripts;
3. The rest of the functions used are from the lab3DDataPreprocessing code.

## Run

1. Ensure all files are in the same directory;
2. Run all cells **in sequence** either manually or via "Run All"/"Run Above".

Take care!
