# Airline Satisfaction Prediction

Team data science research project for fictional airline. Dataset, report, code file format and rest of project completed according to strict restraints from the academic institution.

Data Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/teejmahal20/airline-passenger-satisfaction
Contributors: Myself (lead), 2 others, and a fourth, uncredited (no contribution) member

## Deliverables

1. A single pdf report containing:
  - introduction to the business problem,
  - how the project will be of benefit,
  - project aims, KPIs
  - the dataset, models, modelling metrics
  - the approach adopted
  - EDA,
  - data preprocessing,
  - analysis of results
  - conclusions and recommendations
  - contributions from team members

2. A single, unified R script containing all the associated code (unfortunately - ~2k+ lines !!)


## Project Structure

1. The main pipeline is in R-markdown format for ease of running, under "G25_fullPipeline.Rmd";
2. Preprocess.R is a custom written (with minor incorporation of basic functions from lab 3) "library" of functions used in the main scripts;
3. The rest (1-2 functions) used are borrowed from lab3.

## Run

1. Ensure all files are in the same directory;
2. Run all cells **in sequence** (due to the flow of experiments & restriction to one R script file) either manually or via "Run All"/"Run Above".
